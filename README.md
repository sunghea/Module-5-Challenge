This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

Prepare the Data: Clean and combine the dataset for analysis.

Generate Summary Statistics: Calculate mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts: Visualize the data with bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot: Analyze the quartiles, identify potential outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot: Generate line plots to show tumor volume changes over time and scatter plots to explore the relationship between mouse weight and tumor volume.

Calculate Correlation and Regression: Determine the correlation coefficient and create a linear regression model for mouse weight and average tumor volume.

Submit Your Final Analysis: Provide a summary of your findings and insights from the analysis.
